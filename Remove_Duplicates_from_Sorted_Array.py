Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        index = 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
                nums[index] = nums[i]
                index +=1
        return index
